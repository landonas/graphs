# VNA Graph
![Alt text](https://github.com/lsoriano808/graphs/blob/master/Eigenvector-centrality.png)
This is an assignment from my ICS 311 (algorithms) course under Professor Dr. Suthers. 
The program will read in input in a VNA format, and analyze the data to come up with relationships between nodes. The program uses a [Graph ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) to store data.  I have added functions that can, based upon realtionships between the data, come up with predictions of data. This project is currently being applied to other input formats and has served as a way for me to better understand and evaluate big data. I see this project as my springboard into a better understanding big data.
