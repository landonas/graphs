# graphs
This is an old homework assignment from my ICS 311 (algorithms) course from Professor Dr. Suthers. 
The program will read in input in a VNA format, and analyze the data to come up with relationships between nodes. The program uses a [Graph ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) to store data.
